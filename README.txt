The exercise is 15.1

Originally, it paint the three function.
However, it just can enter a number to get value.

Total eight class:
1. class AbstractionDrawFunction,
2. class functionOne ( x * x )
3. class functionTwo ( sin(x))
4. class functionThree ( cos(x) )
5. class functionFour ( tan(x) )
6. class functionFive ( cos(x) + 5 * sin(x) )
7. class functionSix ( 5 * cos(x) + sin(x) )
8. class functionSeven ( log(x) + x * x )

The relationship of classes:

                JPanel
                  |
        AbstractionDrawFunction(abstract)
                  |
            Function 1 ~ 7
